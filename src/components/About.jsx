          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm an undergraduate student passionate about web development and
            creating meaningful digital experiences. With a strong foundation in
            computer science, I'm constantly learning new technologies and best
            practices in modern web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love solving complex problems through code and enjoy collaborating
            with others on exciting projects. When I'm not coding, you'll find
            me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects,
            or brainstorming innovative ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm eager to take on challenging projects that will expand my skills
            and allow me to make a positive impact.
